# HTTP client

After you have successfully created an HTTP server to respond to client requests, you now need to develop an HTTP client that can take a request and return the  server's respond.

## Client

The client is responsible to connect to the server via `ForecastClient` function, ask for the forecast, and return the result with any possible error that have occured.
